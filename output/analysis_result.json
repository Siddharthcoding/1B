      "content": "Protocols\nIn computer networks, communication occurs \nbetween entities in different systems. However, \ntwo entities can not simply send bit streams to \neach other and expect to be understood.\nFor communication to occur, the entities must \nagree on a protocol. A protocol is a set of rules that \ngovern data communications. \nA protocol defines what is communicated, how it is \ncommunicated, and when it is communicated. \nSyntax refers to the structure or format of the data, meaning \nthe order in which they are presented. For example, a simple \nprotocol might expect the first 8 bits of data to be the \naddress of the sender, the second 8 bits to be the address of \nthe receiver, and the rest of the stream to be the message \nitself.\nSemantics refers to the meaning of each section of bits.\nHow is a particular pattern to be interpreted, and what \naction is to be taken based on that interpretation? For \nexample, does an address identify the route to be taken or \nthe final destination of the message?\nTiming refers to two characteristics: when data should be \nsent and how fast they can be sent. For example, if a sender \nproduces data at 100 Mbps but the receiver can process data \nat only 1 Mbps, the transmission will overload the receiver \nand some data will be lost.\nThe key elements of a protocol \nare syntax, semantics, and timing.\nDr.Sushruta Mishra (CN lecture notes)",

For example, if client1 \nwants to send some data to client 2, then it first \nsends the request to the server for the \npermission. The server sends the response to \nthe client 1 to initiate its communication with \nthe client 2.\nDr.Sushruta Mishra (CN lecture notes)",

If some error occurs in the middle \nof the transmission of data, then the transmission will take place again \nfrom the checkpoint. This process is known as Synchronization and \nrecovery.\nDr.Sushruta Mishra (CN lecture notes)",

So to ensure, national and worldwide \ndata communication, systems must be developed which are \ncompatible to communicate with each other.\nISO developed a standard. ISO stands for International \norganization of Standardization. This is called a model for \nOpen System Interconnection (OSI) and is commonly known \nas OSI model.\nThe purpose of the OSI model is to show how to facilitate \ncommunication between different systems without requiring \nchanges to the logic of the underlying hardware and software.\nOSI consists of seven layers, and each layer performs a particular \nnetwork function. OSI model divides the whole task into seven \nsmaller and manageable tasks. Each layer is assigned a \nparticular task.\nDr.Sushruta Mishra (CN lecture notes)",
